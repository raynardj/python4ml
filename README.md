#### Originally designed to teach Alex python, thank you for your constant learning enthusiasm


#### Also created for [coderbunker](http://www.coderbunker.com/co-learning) deep learning talk sessions

This course is the basic deep learning course that follows closely on Jeremy Howard's fantasic /free /life-changing [fast.ai course](course.fast.ai). 

The most of notebooks are just trails we left behind passing on their awesomeness.

* A PyTorch [training wrapper](https://raynardj.github.io/ray/docs/matchbox) to simplify tracking

### Environment Installation

Follow the [installation instructions](https://raynardj.github.io/python4ml/docs/INSTALL)

Run the jupyter notebook on anaconda3 environment

Usual pre-requisites for the learning. 

```
python 3.6

numpy == '1.14.3'
pandas == '0.23.0'
tensorflow == '1.8.0'
keras == '2.2.0'
```

Other versions of above library will probably work.

Assuming your anaconda3 is at ```~/anaconda3/```

If you don't have any of these, try the following format in the command line:
```
~/anaconda3/bin/pip install keras==2.2.0
```
If you are on Mac:
```
~/anaconda3/bin/pip install torch torchvision
```
To install PyTorch. For other system, You'll have to visit their [homepage](https://pytorch.org/) to copy/paste the right command to install.

### Ray

In some lines of code you might see

```python
from ray import matchbox
```

or
```
from ray.lprint import lprint
```

Yeah, I listened to my friends any named my tool belt ray.

Ray is a github repository [here](https://github.com/raynardj/ray)
